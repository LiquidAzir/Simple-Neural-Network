# Simple Neural Network from Scratch

## Overview
This project demonstrates the creation of a simple neural network built entirely in Python, based on principles discussed in the book "Essential Math for Data Science". The neural network is designed to explore the fundamentals of neural computation including layers, weights, biases, and activation functions. The primary goal is to provide a hands-on approach to understanding how neural networks operate internally without relying on high-level libraries.

## Features
- **Custom Neural Network Architecture**: Implements basic neural network components such as layers and nodes from scratch.
- **Activation Functions**: Utilizes activation functions to introduce non-linearity.
- **Backpropagation**: Includes a simple implementation of backpropagation to adjust the weights of the network based on the error rate.

## Technologies
- Python
- NumPy for numerical operations

## Setup
To run this project, clone the repository and ensure that you have Python installed. Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy
```bash

Execute the notebook using Jupyter:
```bash
jupyter notebook

## Usage
Open the Simple Neural Network from Scratch.ipynb in Jupyter and run the cells to see how the neural network is built and operates on data, following insights gained from the book "Essential Math for Data Science".
